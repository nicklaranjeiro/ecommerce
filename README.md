# Ecommerce Website

I wanted to get use to integrating a payment gateway onto a website so I decided to learn Stripe. This is a very simplistic site of a shop and can be viewed [here](https://nicklaranjeiro.github.io/ecommerce). You can go through the entire payment process and add a credit card to pay for the products, the payment is then sent to stripe account to process and finalize the payment.
